# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal blog repository (sm-blog) containing technical articles and blog posts organized by year. The repository contains markdown files with Chinese technical content covering frontend development, Node.js, Linux, and JavaScript topics.

## Repository Structure

- **Year-based organization**: Articles are organized in directories by year (2017/, 2018/, 2025/)
- **Naming convention**: Articles follow the pattern `00X_标题.md` where X is sequential numbering
- **Content focus**: Technical blog posts primarily in Chinese covering:
  - Frontend development concepts
  - Node.js applications and deployment
  - JavaScript fundamentals and advanced topics
  - Linux server administration
  - Development tools and workflows

## File Management

- **Language**: All content is in Chinese
- **Format**: Markdown files with technical explanations, code examples, and tutorials
- **Assets**: Static assets are stored in the `assets/` directory
- **Git tracking**: The repository tracks changes to existing markdown files

## Content Guidelines

When working with this repository:
- Maintain the year-based directory structure
- Follow the existing numbered naming convention for new articles
- Keep content in Chinese unless specifically requested otherwise
- Preserve the technical tutorial format with code examples and explanations
- Update the README.md index when adding new articles

## Development Notes

- This is a static content repository with no build process or dependencies
- The `index.js` file exists but is currently empty
- No package.json or build tools are configured
- Content is managed through direct markdown file editing
